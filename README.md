# Password Generator

 ## Description 
This is a password generator designed to let you customize how your password is generated.
You can customize the length, select from lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols.
After you have entered a desired length, and chosen which characters to include in your password, javascript automatically randomizes through your characters selections making you a custom password with all of your requirements.
